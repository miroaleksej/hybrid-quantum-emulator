## Checklist

<!--
Please check the following before submitting:
-->

- [ ] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/quantum-research/hybrid-quantum-emulator/issues) to ensure this feature request is new
- [ ] I understand that feature requests that align with the project roadmap and follow the principle *"Linear operations — in optics, non-linearities and memory — in CMOS"* have higher priority
- [ ] I have considered how this feature would work with the telemetry system and auto-calibration
- [ ] I have thought about the end-to-end metrics this would improve (not just the core component)
- [ ] I have considered platform-specific implementation (SOI, SiN, TFLN, InP)
- [ ] I have considered WDM parallelism opportunities
